## Things you are

Assign your four Ability stats. Either place [2, 2, 1, 1] among the stats, or start with all 1s and roll d6:

## Defensive stats and your Pocket

Set **Evade** to 4 and **Limit** to 10, adjusting for any equipment. On your **Hit Track** draw a vertical line to the right of your Evade value and another to the left of your Limit value.

Set your **Pocket** to d6. Itâ€™s your momentum and luck. Track it with a d6 that fluctuates as you act, take hits, and regain your composure. Keep a die face-up to its current value. Place that die on your **Hit Track** to mark your **Defense**, which is equal to **Evade plus Pocket**.
