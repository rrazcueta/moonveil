# Encounters

Encounters are run in **Rounds**. Each Round starts with a roll to determine when your Seeker can act. And it continues until you’re safe… or dead.

## Split Initiative

At the beginning of every Round, roll d6 for your Seeker to determine if you can act before or after the enemies. Reroll by marking Dexterity.

- If you rolled a 4 or more then you can act first before the enemies
- Then, the enemies all act
- If you rolled a 3 or less then you have to act after the enemies

When you act you can take a Move and an Action in any order alongside other Seekers acting at the same time.
