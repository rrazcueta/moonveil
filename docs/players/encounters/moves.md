# Movement

Distances are measured by the number of Moves needed to cross them. 0 Moves means something is nearby and can be acted on immediately. 1 Move takes one Move to reach, 2 Moves takes two Moves, and so on.

## Obstacles

If an enemy blocks your path, roll a DC10 Dexterity check to Pass:

- Roll with Advantage if the enemy is engaged with someone or something else.
- Roll with Disadvantage if multiple enemies block the way or the space is too narrow.
- Failure: the blocking enemy gets a free attack.
- Or if the space is large enough, you may spend a Move to freely pass the enemy

Allies and other environmental factors may hinder your movement as well. When traversing through difficult environments roll a **Slip Check**.
