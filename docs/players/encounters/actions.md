# Actions

When you take an action, choose from one of these or anything else you could reasonably attempt in a handful of seconds.

## Attack

Make an attack to damage an enemy. First confirm the target:

- Melee: a nearby enemy, 0 Moves away. The opposing side chooses which enemy
- Ranged: an enemy of your choice up to 2 Moves away.

Then roll 2d6 and compare both dice against the target’s **Evade**, **Defense**, and **Limit** to determine if and how hard the attack hits.

| Thresholds | Tier             | Damage           |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| ≤ Evade    | **Miss**         | 0                |
| < Defense  | **Weak Hit**     | 1                |
| ≥ Defense  | **Strong Hit**   | Bigger Die Value |
| ≥ Limit    | **Critical Hit** | Bigger Die Value |

Weapons and abilities can add extra effects when you score a hit. These can trigger at any tier, but most often on Critical Hits.

## Stagger Attack

Make a melee attack to throw the enemy off-balance. Confirm the target and then roll 2d6 against the enemy's Defense and Limit.

| Thresholds | Effect      |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| < Defense  | None        |
| ≥ Defense  | One Effect  |
| ≥ Limit    | Two Effects |

Choose from the follow effects:

- The enemy rolls a **Slip Check**.
- Recover your Move OR force the enemy to Move 1
- Deal damage as if you scored a Weak Hit
