# Et Cetera

## Death

When your Seeker is **at 0 or less HP they are dead**. Roll a new Seeker.

## Moon Effects

Each day, The Moonveil curses your Seekers with a new Moon Effect. After a rest, roll d66 for an effect. Moon effects stack until you find safety from The Moonveil.

## Growth

When your Seeker reaches a milestone, Level Up. Gain +1 in an Ability Stat. Increase HP accordingly.

## Rest

In a safe space outside of an encounter, eat a meal and spend 8 hours recovering to recover.

- Erase all marked pips, recover lost Spells and Miracles
- Heal HP. Roll a number of d6 equal to your Level, add 3xStrength, and set your HP to this total if you choose.
