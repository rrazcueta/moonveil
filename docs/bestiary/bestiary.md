# Bestiary

Enemies operate approximately like Seekers. Key differences:

- No Gambits, stats
- No explicit level

Basic enemy stat blocks have: HP, Evade, and Limit.

HP is given as d6s and/or modifiers. Sometimes it will be Xd6 where you roll that many d6s. Other times it will be d6/2 or d6/3 where you divide the result and round up (the only place where you should round up).

Evade and Limit operate the same as with a Seeker.

Instead of stats, enemies might roll 3 or more d6. Roll the dice and use the best 2.

If no attack is displayed, take the bigger die for a Strong Hit.
