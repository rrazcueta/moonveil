First determine your Ability stats. Distribute [3, 2, 1, 1] to your Ability Stats or roll d66:

On 1-3 and…

1: 3 Strength, 2 Dexterity, 1, and 1

2. 3 Strength, 2 Arcane, 1, and 1

3. 3 Strength, 2 Willpower, 1, and 1

1: 3 Dexterity, 2 Strength, 1, and 1

2. 3 Dexterity, 2 Arcane, 1, and 1

3. 3 Dexterity, 2 Willpower, 1, and 1

or 4-6 and…

1: 3 Arcane, 2 Strength, 1, and 1

2. 3 Arcane, 2 Dexterity, 1, and 1

3. 3 Arcane, 2 Willpower, 1, and 1

1: 3 Willpower, 2 Strength, 1, and 1

2. 3 Willpower, 2 Dexterity, 1, and 1

3. 3 Willpower, 2 Arcane, 1, and 1

Then determine your **Hit Points**. Set HP to 1d6 + 3xStrength.

Set **Evade** to 4 and **Limit** to 10. On the **Hit Track** draw a vertical line to the right of your Evade value and another vertical line to the left of your Limit value.

Set your **Pocket** to d6. It’s your momentum and luck. Track it with a d6 that fluctuates as you act, take hits, and regain your composure. Keep a die face-up to its current value. Place that die on your **Hit Track** to mark your **Defense**, which is equal to **Evade plus Pocket**.

Choose or roll d66 twice for your starting **items**, **spells**, or **miracles**:

On 1-2 get a weapon. Describe it and give it a name.

1: **Edged**, min 3 dmg

2: **Piercing**, +1 dmg Strong Hit

3: **Heavy**, +d6 dmg Critical Hit

4: **Silent** & **Range** 2

5: **Tricky**, Slip Check Strong Hit

6: A bomb, huge damage, area

Or 3-4 get defensive equipment. Describe it and give it a name.

1: **Helmet**, +1 Limit

2-3: **Shield**, Pocket 4+? +1 Evade

4-5: **Armor**, Dmg in -1

6: **Cloak**, Reroll Pocket on Move

Or 5 and…

1-3: **Healing Circle**, DC10 Willpower - d6 HP to an area

4-6: **Dawn Arm**, DC10 Willpower - weapon gains temporary +d6 damage

Or 6 and…

1-2: **Air Pressure**, **Moonsmell**, and **Heavylight**, DC8 Arcane - solutions

3-4: **Egress** and **Invisibility**, DC9 Arcane - escape tools

5: **Sleepsand** - DC12 Arcane - sleep

6: **Magic Orb** - DC10 Arcane - 2d6 area dmg

Finally take d6 **Coin** and 2 **Dungeon Gear**.

# How To Play

In Moonveil you and the Guide cooperate to tell a story about your Seekers as they look for Moonshards in The Moonveil. If at any point there are multiple possible outcomes, bring out the dice. The Guide determines the dice to roll and how the rolls map to possibilities in their shared story. Then you roll dice.

## 2d6 Pocket Roll

Whenever something significant happens to a Seeker, you roll 2d6. If the result is unfavorable you can choose to do one or both of

1. **Pocket Swap**: Replace one of the dice with your **Pocket**
2. **Reroll**: Mark a pip in a relevant stat and roll again.

Most of the time rolling at or over the **Dice Check** (**DC**) is a success and rolling under is a failure. For example, rolls against a DC9 succeed at 9 and up, and fail at 8 and below. Other times, like during an Attack Roll, there are multiple thresholds to compare.

### Stat Pips

Each stat – **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Arcane**, and **Willpower** – measures a Seeker’s endurance in that domain. When marking pips, you can only mark a number of pips up to that stat’s value.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

In a particularly strong or weak position, you roll one extra die.

- **Advantage**: remove the lowest die result.
- **Disadvantage**: remove the highest die result.

### Slip Check

Some effects do not cause real danger - but they do represent a loss. On a **Slip Check** roll d6 against Pocket then set the Pocket to the lower value. Mark Dexterity to reroll.

## Death

When your Seeker is **at 0 or less HP they are dead**. Roll a new Seeker.

## Moon Effects

Each day, The Moonveil curses your Seekers with a new Moon Effect. After a rest, roll d66 for an effect. Moon effects stack until you find safety from The Moonveil.

## Items & Inventory

Exploring the Moonveil means hauling gear — and sometimes hauling friends. Track everything you carry in **Equipment & Backpack**.

- **Slots**: Most items take up 1 slot. Larger items take up 2 or more slots.
- **Extra**: Small things like letters, keys, or coins are free to carry

### Capacity

Your carrying capacity is **6 plus Willpower**. When carrying more you are **Encumbered** and roll everything at Disadvantage. You cannot carry more than 12 total slots.

### Dungeon Gear

**Dungeon Gear** is a special item that always takes 1 slot. When you need it, you can pull it from your pack as any common adventuring tool you could reasonably buy.

### Carrying Allies

Carrying a fallen ally, without their gear, takes 6 slots. You will need additional slots for your gear and any gear of theirs as well.

##

## Encounters

Encounters are run in **Rounds**. Each Round starts with a roll to determine when your Seeker can act. And it continues until you’re safe… or dead.

### Split Initiative

At the beginning of every Round, roll d6 for your Seeker to determine if you can act before or after the enemies. Reroll by marking Dexterity.

- If you rolled a 4 or more then you can act first before the enemies
- Then, the enemies all act
- If you rolled a 3 or less then you have to act after the enemies

### Movement

Measure distance by the number of Moves needed to cross it. 0 Moves means something is nearby. 1 Move takes one Move to reach, 2 Moves takes two Moves, and so on.

#### Obstacles

If an enemy blocks your path, roll a DC10 Dexterity check to Pass:

- Roll with Advantage if the enemy is engaged with someone or something else.
- Roll with Disadvantage if multiple enemies block the way or the space is too narrow.
- Failure: the blocking enemy gets a free attack.
- Or If the space is large enough you may spend a Move to freely pass the enemy

Allies and other environmental factors can hinder your movement as well. Roll a **Slip Check**, d6 against Pocket, and take the lower value as the new Pocket.

###

### Attacks

When making an attack, first confirm the target:

- Melee: a nearby enemy, 0 Moves away. The opposing side chooses which enemy
- Ranged: an enemy of your choice up to 2 Moves away.

Then roll 2d6 and compare against the target’s **Evade**, **Defense**, and **Limit**:

- ≤ Evade: **Miss** - No damage
- &lt; Defense: **Weak Hit** - Damage 1
- ≥ Defense: **Strong Hit** - Damage equal to the bigger die
- ≥ Limit: **Critical Hit** - Damage equal to the bigger die

Weapons and abilities can add extra effects when you score a hit. These can trigger at any tier, but most often on Critical Hits.

### Gambits

You may wager your Ability stats to perform Gambits.

#### Power

You can use Power before a melee attack if you have at least 1 pip of Strength.

- Get up to d6 bonus damage, up to the attack’s normal damage.
- Apply this damage to the original target OR to each nearby enemy.
- If your attack roll is less than 10, mark all your Strength.

#### Finesse

You can use Finesse before a melee attack if you have at least 1 pip of Dexterity.

- Choose the target among nearby enemies.
- Before your attack the target rolls a Slip Check.
- After the attack, you recover your Move OR force the enemy to Move 1
- If your attack roll is less than 10, mark all your Dexterity.

#### Defensive Action

You can use Defensive Action after being hit if you have at least 1 pip of Dexterity.

- Roll DC10 Dexterity. On success, negate all damage.
- On failure, take full damage and mark all your Dexterity.

## Special Actions

Unique actions cost time, Ability stats, or other resources. In exploration, if one of these actions costs an Action or Move, the Guide determines if there’s time or if there are other risks involved.

### Quick Move

In combat, spend an Action to gain a Move.

### Footing

When you have time, reroll your Pocket and keep the new result.

- In an encounter, spend a Move to regain your Footing
- In exploration, the Guide determines if you have enough time

### Stagger

In combat, roll against a target’s Defense to force them into a **Slip Check**.

### Deduction

Spend an Action, mark 1 Arcane, and work with the Guide to gain insight.

- Usable in an encounter spend an Action or exploration
- Identify an Advantage over a challenge or enemy
- Or remove a Disadvantage affecting your group.

Refund if the result is not useful.

### Rally

In an encounter or exploration, spend an Action and mark 1 Willpower to

- Erase marked pips in Strength, Dexterity, and Arcane
- Restore 1d6 Hit Points

### Rest

In a safe space outside of an encounter, eat a meal and spend 8 hours recovering to

- Erase all marked pips, recover lost Spells and Miracles
- Heal HP. Roll a number of d6 equal to your Level, add 3xStrength, and set your HP to this total if you choose.

## Magic

Magic comes in two forms: Spells and Miracles. Spells are shaped by knowledge of the Arcane. Miracles are drawn forth by sheer Willpower.

### Casting Magic

When you cast a Spell or Miracle, roll 2d6 against its DC:

- Success: Roll ≥ DC – the effect takes place.
- Failure: Roll &lt; DC – the effect fizzles, and you lose it until you Rest.
- Terrible Failure: ≤ The Verge – roll against Arcane Mishaps or Penance

### Arcane Mishaps

3 or better nothing happens

2: Take d6 damage

1: Take d6 damage, mark d6 pips

### Penance

A failed Miracle burdens you with Guilt. Track Guilt with slots in your inventory. If you hold more Guilt than you can carry, you are **Encumbered**, and roll everything at Disadvantage.

3 or better nothing happens

2: You gain one slot of Guilt

1: Double your Guilt or gain one slot if you have none.

## Growth

When your Seeker reaches a milestone, Level Up. Gain +1 in an Ability Stat. Increase HP accordingly.
