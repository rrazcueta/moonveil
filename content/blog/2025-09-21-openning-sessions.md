It's Keep On The Borderlands but Moonveil!

# Session 1

We had four players: Tim, Dan (Peter), Harry (Ribbit), and Steve.

We played with Gambits for the first time. The Gambits this session were pretty powerful and low cost. You had to wager 1 point to do them.

They took down two battles with Kobolds pretty easily. Magic Orb was pretty overpowered with 3d6 damage - it's supposed to blow up on the players often, but it didn't feel good to force that on the players.

Father Presylvanus and his two Acolytes accompanied the group. They were pretty into the carnage.

## Afterward

- Father 'Pretzel' told the townspeople of the heroes exploits. At least a few bought you drinks. The smith and the shopkeep are excited to see what you might be purchasing...
- You were invited to stay at the church rectory until suddenly you were kicked out. Knocking with the heavy iron rings on the entrance go unanswered.

## Tavern Rumours

- “A farmer’s boy claims he saw a mound of lizard men moving through the marshes, dragging a screaming prisoner behind them.”
- “Folks near the hills whisper that the old kobold caves are alive again—lights and eerie laughter echo from inside after dark.”

# Session 2

We had two players: Dan (Peter), and Harry (Ribbit). They did some shopping before heading out: Peter equipped a Cloak and Harry purchased a special Halberd Strong Hit +2, Critical Hit +d6x

This time lost Gambits lose all the relevant pips. And we played with Split Initiative.

## Encounter 1

They heard a rumour of some Lizardmen causing some trouble. They got into one encounter in a river, took some damage from Javelins, and then opted to run away. Then they tracked the Lizard people to their base. At the base they freed a guard the Lizardmen had kidnapped and took the Lizardmen out 3 to 6.

5x Lizardmen: 8 HP; 4 Evade; 10 Limit; Javelin Poke 3d6, Range 1 Javelin 2d6
1x Lizard Bigman: same... 12 HP and a special 3d6 Spear Min 2, Strong Hit +1

## Encounter 2

They brought Stannis the Merchant and Varnis the Guard back to town where they discussed bandits with Brandt the Storekeep. Bandits have stolen some goods that the Storekeep and the Smith need to produce goods. The two hired Varnis for 15 Coin hoping to reap more treasury with his help.

They found the Bandits holed up south of the Keep. Opting not to attack the Bandits in the woods, they went straight for their hideout. They called out the Bandits and got arrowed from above.

3x Sword Bandit: 12 HP; 4 Evade; 10 Limit; 3d6 Sword Min 3; Shield
4x Archer Bandit: 8 HP; 4 Evade; 10 Limit; 3d6 Bow Range 2

Unfortunately after 3 rounds Ribbit and Varnis were cut down. Peter dropped gear to pick up Ribbit's body. Things left behind:

- Lizard Spear
- Special Halberd
- Red Badger Trading Company Banner
- Medium Armor
- Varnis
