# Items & Inventory

Exploring the Moonveil means hauling gear â€” and sometimes hauling friends. Track everything you carry in **Equipment & Backpack**.

- **Slots**: Most items take up 1 slot. Larger items take up 2 or more slots.
- **Extra**: Small things like letters, keys, or coins are free to carry

## Capacity

Your carrying capacity is **6 plus Willpower**. When carrying more you are **Encumbered** and roll everything at Disadvantage. You cannot carry more than 12 total slots.

## Dungeon Gear

**Dungeon Gear** is a special item that always takes 1 slot. When you need it, you can pull it from your pack as any common adventuring tool you could reasonably buy.

## Carrying Allies

Carrying a fallen ally, without their gear, takes 6 slots. You will need additional slots for your gear and any gear of theirs as well.
