# Encounters

Encounters are run in **Rounds**. Each Round starts with a roll to determine when your Seeker can act. And it continues until you’re safe… or dead.

## Split Initiative

At the beginning of every Round, roll d6 for your Seeker to determine if you can act before or after the enemies. Reroll by marking Dexterity.

- If you rolled a 4 or more then you can act first before the enemies
- Then, the enemies all act
- If you rolled a 3 or less then you have to act after the enemies

## Movement

Measure distance by the number of Moves needed to cross it. 0 Moves means something is nearby. 1 Move takes one Move to reach, 2 Moves takes two Moves, and so on.

### Obstacles

If an enemy blocks your path, roll a DC10 Dexterity check to Pass:

- Roll with Advantage if the enemy is engaged with someone or something else.
- Roll with Disadvantage if multiple enemies block the way or the space is too narrow.
- Failure: the blocking enemy gets a free attack.
- Or If the space is large enough you may spend a Move to freely pass the enemy

Allies and other environmental factors can hinder your movement as well. Roll a **Slip Check**, d6 against Pocket, and take the lower value as the new Pocket.

## Attacks

When making an attack, first confirm the target:

- Melee: a nearby enemy, 0 Moves away. The opposing side chooses which enemy
- Ranged: an enemy of your choice up to 2 Moves away.

Then roll 2d6 and compare against the target’s **Evade**, **Defense**, and **Limit**:

- ≤ Evade: **Miss** - No damage
- &lt; Defense: **Weak Hit** - Damage 1
- ≥ Defense: **Strong Hit** - Damage equal to the bigger die
- ≥ Limit: **Critical Hit** - Damage equal to the bigger die

Weapons and abilities can add extra effects when you score a hit. These can trigger at any tier, but most often on Critical Hits.

## Gambits

You may wager your Ability stats to perform Gambits.

### Power

Use Power before a melee attack if you have at least 1 pip of Strength.

- Roll d6 bonus damage
- Applied to the original target OR to each nearby enemy
- If your attack roll is less than 10, mark all your Strength.

### Finesse

Use Finesse before a melee attack if you have at least 1 pip of Dexterity.

- Choose a target among nearby enemies.
- Before your attack the target rolls a Slip Check.
- After your attack, recover your Move OR force the enemy to Move 1
- If your attack roll is less than 10, mark all your Dexterity.

### Defensive Action

Use Defensive Action after being hit if you have at least 1 pip of Dexterity.

- Roll DC10 Dexterity. On success, negate all damage.
- On failure, take full damage and mark all your Dexterity.
