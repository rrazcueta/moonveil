# 2d6 Pocket Roll

Whenever something significant happens to a Seeker, you roll 2d6. If the result is unfavorable you can choose to do one or both of

1. **Pocket Swap**: Replace one of the dice with your **Pocket**
2. **Reroll**: Mark a pip in a relevant stat and roll again.

Most of the time rolling at or over the **Dice Check** (**DC**) is a success and rolling under is a failure. For example, rolls against a DC9 succeed at 9 and up, and fail at 8 and below. Other times, like during an Attack Roll, there are multiple thresholds to compare.

## Stat Pips

Each stat – **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Arcane**, and **Willpower** – measures a Seeker’s endurance in that domain. When marking pips, you can only mark a number of pips up to that stat’s value.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

In a particularly strong or weak position, you roll one extra die.

- **Advantage**: remove the lowest die result.
- **Disadvantage**: remove the highest die result.

# Slip Check

Some effects do not cause real danger - but they do represent a loss. On a **Slip Check** roll d6 against Pocket then set the Pocket to the lower value. Mark Dexterity to reroll.
