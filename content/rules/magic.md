# Magic

Magic comes in two forms: Spells and Miracles. Spells are shaped by knowledge of the Arcane. Miracles are drawn forth by sheer Willpower.

## Casting Magic

When you cast a Spell or Miracle, roll 2d6 against its DC:

- Success: Roll ≥ DC – the effect takes place.
- Failure: Roll &lt; DC – the effect fizzles, and you lose it until you Rest.
- Terrible Failure: ≤ The Verge – roll against Arcane Mishaps or Penance

## Arcane Mishaps

3 or better nothing happens

2: Take d6 damage

1: Take d6 damage, mark d6 pips

## Penance

A failed Miracle burdens you with Guilt. Track Guilt with slots in your inventory. If you hold more Guilt than you can carry, you are **Encumbered**, and roll everything at Disadvantage.

3 or better nothing happens

2: You gain one slot of Guilt

1: Double your Guilt or gain one slot if you have none.
